## The JSONata type system

## Sequences

Explain sequences vs arrays, singleton sequence equivalence to its value 
Result sequences - why unpack the singleton value - how to preserve an array from a singleton sequence in the result

## The JSONata processing model

(from tech talk ppt)

## The map/filter/reduce programming paradigm

With references to literature

## Generating sequences

From location paths
From literal array constructor
With the range operator

## Generic ‘map’ operator

## The ‘filter’ stage

## Aggregating (reduce)

## JSONata syntax built on this model
