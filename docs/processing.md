## The JSONata type system

JSONata is a superset of JSON and the JSONata type system is a superset of the JSON data types.  In common with all functional programming languages, the function is also a first-class data type.  The following data types are supported by JSONata:

- string
- number
- Boolean
- null
- object
- array
- function

All but the last one are in common with JSON.

## Sequences

Explain sequences vs arrays, singleton sequence equivalence to its value 

Result sequences - why unpack the singleton value - how to preserve an array from a singleton sequence in the result

## The JSONata processing model

(from tech talk ppt)

## The map/filter/reduce programming paradigm

With references to literature

## Generating sequences

From location paths

From literal array constructor

With the range operator

## Generic ‘map’ operator

## The ‘filter’ stage

## Aggregating (reduce)

## JSONata syntax built on this model
